# CreditCardFraudDetection
Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions to minimize financial losses for both credit card companies and cardholders.

Technologies Used

Steps Involved

Data Exploration: Understanding the structure of the dataset, checking for missing values, and exploring basic statistics of the features.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the data by scaling numerical features and handling any class imbalance issues.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Building: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for fraud detection.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizing performance metrics using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the best-performing models to optimize performance.
Deployment: Integrating the trained model into a production environment for real-time fraud detection.
